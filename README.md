# Ornate

Ornate is my capstone project which is basically a design listing platform. The main motive is to induce different designs on one single platform and making design search a blissfull experience for the user.❤️

Ornate will have the following features listed below:-

1)User will be displayed with a list of design which will be pool of different category designs.

2)The category listed displayed on the top will be acting as an filter which will show speicific category design.

3)The next user action will be the sign up feature where the user is supposed to sign up and the can like, add comment or can even add a design to his/her favourites.

4)User can also upload their design which will be potrayed with other designs.
